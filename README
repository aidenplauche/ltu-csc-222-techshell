- The inner workings of the program -
First, the current working directory is displayed, and the user is prompted for input.
This input (256 char max) is stored and the newline is stripped from the end.
If the input equals "exit", the program exits immediately.

Next, this input is broken down into its components and stored in the ShellCommand struct.
Using strtok, the input is split by " ", with each piece being saved in a list of arguments.
The first piece is also saved separately as the binary to be called later.
Before saving, if the argument equals "<", the next argument is saved as the input file.
Additionally, if the argument equals ">", the next argument is saved as the output file.
The output file must be after the input file, and no arguments can be after I/O redirection.
A null filename or any arguments after I/O redirection will be ignored.
(If DEBUG is 1, the contents of the struct and number of arguments will be printed.)

Finally, the command moves to the execution function.
If the binary is null, no command is executed (i.e., nothing was entered).
If the command is "cd", chdir is called (and error information printed if applicable)
Otherwise, the program is forked.
The child redirects stdin and stdout if input/output files are specified respectively.
Then, the child calls execvp with the binary/arguments and prints error info if applicable.
The parent waits for the child to terminate (either by execvp or exit(1) if errored).

After this, the main loop repeats, re-requesting user input.
